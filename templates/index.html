        Mission
    </h1>
    <p>We use historical weather and transport data to predict the safest means of transportation around New York during extreme rain. We do this via a trained AI model that takes in historical datasets of rain, weather, transportation, closures, accidents, etc in New York and predicts a solution based on the userâ€™s input of current conditions. This provides people with data-backed transport options during times of extreme rain.

    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I am from Manhattan and first was inspired to do this project after the extreme rainstorm on September 23, 2023. I drove myself to school that morning from downtown Manhattan to the Bronx, unaware of the extreme conditions that I would be driving through. I felt nervous and unsafe on the road and wanted to think of a way to be prepared and prepare others for future events of extreme rain.
